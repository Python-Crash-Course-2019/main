    "2) A year with 366 days is called a leap year. This is needed to keep the calendar synchronized with the sun. Every year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year. However there's still a small error for years that are divisible by 100. To eliminate that error we consider years that are divisble by 100 as leap years only if they are also divisible by 400 (so for example: 1900 is not counted as a leap year even if it is divisible by 4 because it's also divisible by 100 and not by 400. Whereas 2000 is a leap year as it's divisible by 4, 100 and 400)\n",
