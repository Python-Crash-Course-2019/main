Don't use 'in' for this exercise, but make a while loop that will check every element and print \"Yes fries is in the list\" if it is. If it's not in the list your code should print nothing. (Of course go back to previous exercise and add and/or remove \"fries\" from the list then run your solution to this exercise again and again to test that your code works in every case)"

    "3) Sometimes an input requires to be a number and not a string. Just think about when asking for the age or for a year of birth. However the input function automatically converts an input to a string. We've seen that we can solve this problem by using the int() function this way: int(input(\"Age: \")). However this wouldn't work if the user inputs a word or a text. The int() function cannot convert a word to an integer. The string has to be only composed of digits. Who guarantees that a user of your program won't input for example: \"Twenty one\" instead of \"21\"? If you would ask the input this way: int(input(\"Age: \")) your program would crash after the input of \"Twenty one\". Make a while loop in which you will ask for the age again and again and again until the given input is only composed of digits (internet research).\n",

    "4) Below is a multi-dimensional list or a 'matrix'. This is especially useful for cases where grids are needed. Just think about how a chess board or a 2D game could be represented.
