"""
Here you implement the whole logic of your algorithm, based on the previously declared functions.
1) First generate a new list and save it in a variable.
2) Then you make a while loop. The condition for leaving the while is if there's no more money or that the list is empty.
    3) We ask repeatedly in a loop for a number and check if that number is inside the list using the function 
    "value_is_in_lst" that you had to implement earlier.
        *   If it's inside, you remove that number from the list using the function "remove_number__from_lst()"
            and we calculate the number of still to guess numbers (= length of list) and we print what you have to print
            what is needed to be printed in this case.
        *   If it's not present, with divide the score by two and print what is needed to be printed in this case.

4) Out of the while we check if the user has won the game or not.
